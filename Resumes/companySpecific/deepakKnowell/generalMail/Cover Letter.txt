Dear Sir,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to express my gratitude for your kind offer to help me in my internship hunt! I really appreciate your willingness to help me in my career development.

As you may know, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. My primary focus is on computer vision and deep learning, and I am excited to explore different internship opportunities in this area. Unfortunately, I have found that many major tech companies are experiencing a hiring freeze during this layoff season, and only a few positions are publicly available.

I have attached my resume along with a list of recent open positions in companies I would love to work at and that I would consider as a dream job and an invaluable way to gain experience in this field. I hope this will help identify suitable opportunities for me.

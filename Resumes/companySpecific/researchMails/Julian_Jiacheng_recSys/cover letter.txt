Hi Jiacheng,
I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across your email seeking student volunteers to work on a recommendation service website. This opportunity aligns with my interest, and my skillset makes me an ideal candidate for this opportunity. In fact, a couple of days back, I had joint-mailed Professor Julian, along with a friend of mine, proposing our own recommendation service idea.

I am pursuing a master's in Computer Science, specializing in artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. I took the recommender system course under Professor Julian in the previous fall quarter. As part of the final project, we built a game recommender system using user reviews and hours played from the steam platform.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development as an intern at Makos Infotech. I developed server-side rendering for their main website, Jobaskit.com, using PHP, JQuery, and MySQL. I also managed and created relational AWS-hosted databases using MySQL Workbench. I designed the website's front end using Figma, implemented the same using Html/CSS and Bootstrap, and even co-pitched the product to a university.

I am eager to be a part of this exciting long-term project and contribute to the creation of a fantastic recommendation service website. I am confident that my background in machine learning and web development and my enthusiasm for hands-on experience in a team will make me a valuable asset for this project.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would appreciate the chance to discuss further my qualifications and how I can contribute to work that makes a Difference! Attached is my CV, which further details my experience and skills.

Best Regards,
Jay

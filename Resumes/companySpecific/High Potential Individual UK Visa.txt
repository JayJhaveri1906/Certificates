Hi!

Hope you're having a great day!

Since I have a Master’s in Computer Science from UC San Diego, I’m eligible for the High Potential Individual UK Visa to work there!

I really hope that being in the US won’t affect my chances of pursuing a career in motorsports :)

Thank you for your time and consideration,


Best,
Jay

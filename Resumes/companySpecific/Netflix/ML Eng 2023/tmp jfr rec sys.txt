Hi Joe,
I got to know about this role opening while going through Wendy's email. I found myself an excellent fit for the role when I read about the company and what an SE intern would work on.

To elaborate, in my past internship experiences, I have worked from creating smooth, modern UI/UX models on Figma, handling structured relational databases, to writing an in-depth research paper about my work on the prediction of vaccine acceptance rate based on past pandemic data at leadingIndia.ai. 

Apart from mentoring newer interns and getting them comfortable with the existing code base, I have also co-pitched the company's online campus placement portal "Jobaskit" to a University, hoping to secure funding.

Further, during my Masters in CS at UCSD, as part of the Recommendation Systems course, I got familiar with the theory behind collaborative filtering and latent factor models concerning recommending and predicting user behaviors. I implemented this knowledge in the final thesis report of the course by analyzing reviews of users and how likely they were trying to recommend a product.
 
Thank you for considering and taking the time out of your day. My past experiences and my affinity towards problem-solving will make me a great backend NetSpringer.

Best,
Jay Jhaveri

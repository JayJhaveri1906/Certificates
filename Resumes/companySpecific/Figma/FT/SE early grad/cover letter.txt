I have been using Figma since my first year of undergrad to quickly come up with beautiful wireframes alongside my teammates.
I would love to be a part of a team in a company whose product itself promotes teamwork and quality! :)

Here's to a future Figmate in working!

P.S.: Loved the 30-60 days bottom-up approach you guys have for new grads!ðŸ§¡

-----

- Solid technical knowledge of CS fundamentals and data structures

Apart from having taken multiple data structure courses, I have developed numerous projects and optimized them using efficient data structures and CS fundamentals.

- Fluency with one or more general-purpose programming languages, including but not limited to Javascript, Ruby, Python, C++, Objective-C, or Java

I am proficient in Python, Java, Javascript, and C.

- Ability to communicate technical problems and solutions

I strongly believe that 20% of a SE job is coding, while 80% of being a successful Software Engineer is effective communication!

- A growth mindset with an eagerness to learn and contribute not only to your engineering team but to the entire organization


Absolutely! Just like a Doctor an Engineer too can never stop learning and being on top of new trends in the tech world and how it can end up being useful to the entire organization and team members alike!


- An inclusive and collaborative attitude towards building features and solving problems

Building on my previous answer, effective communication cannot happen if you don't build a safe and open environment among your teammates!

Dear Hiring Manager, University Recruiter, Epic Games,

Since I was a kid, the only two things I have loved doing are programming and playing games. I have previously led a team of 4 while developing my Research Project, Divya Drishti, aimed at facilitating the day-to-day life of Visually Impaired people. These very same group members turned into my squad during the weekends, in turn helping us build our team communication skills while rushing A site on Ascent! Being a rioter is the closest I can come to join my two passions.

I was around 5 years old when I got interested in working with computers. This early life hobby developed into a passion when I took up HTML and JAVA programming as a course in my 9th and 10th grades. It was here that I truly learned my love for coding. I followed my passion and took up computer engineering as my bachelor’s degree. I learned a lot during this journey. The most important thing I learned is that I have only yet reached the tip of the iceberg regarding coding knowledge. Hence, my next goal is to dig deeper and refine known concepts. Hence the reason to take up computer science as my master’s degree.

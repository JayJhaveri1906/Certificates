I was around 5 years old when I first became interested in working with computers. This early life hobby developed into a passion when I took up HTML and JAVA programming in my 9th and 10th standard. It was then that I truly discovered my love for coding. I have continued to pursue this passion and completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Through this journey, I learned that there is still so much more to learn and discover in this field. My next goal is to further develop my knowledge and skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is why I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.

I believe that my passion for coding, coupled with my background in computer engineering and ongoing education in computer science, make me a strong candidate for the Machine Learning Intern position at Discord. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on a platform team that aims to create the best experience throughout the machine learning workflow at Discord. I am also eager to continue learning and refining my knowledge in the field, and I believe that Discord will provide the perfect opportunity to do so while contributing to the company's mission of building an environment where everyone is a click, text chat, or voice call away.

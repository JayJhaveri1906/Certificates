Hello, my name is Jay, and I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for data science and machine learning. I am currently pursuing my Masters of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and am expected to graduate in Dec 2023. I have a strong academic background, with a CGPA of 3.9/4 and have taken relevant courses such as Recommender Systems, Computer Vision, and AI: Probabilistic Reasoning.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained valuable experience through internships in both full-stack development and data analysis. I have worked with companies such as Makos Infotech and Leadingindia.ai, where I have had the opportunity to apply my skills and make a real impact. I am also a self-starter and have taken on several projects, including developing a secure off-the-grid chat application and a voice-activated standalone application for the visually impaired.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to TikTok as an MLE intern. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate to be at TikTok, and I am eager to grow and develop while learning from the world-class leaders at Tiktok.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would appreciate the chance to discuss further my qualifications and how I can contribute to something that people worldwide get real value from! Please feel free to contact me at your convenience by email (jjhaveri@ucsd.edu) or by telephone (+1 858 214 9192).

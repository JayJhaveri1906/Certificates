Tensorflow or Pytorch?

I am pretty comfortable with both.
If I had to choose one, I would choose PyTorch just because that's what is most extensively used in Academia, and over the course of my 5 years of dealing with machine learning, I have more experience with Pytorch than Tensorflow.
Apart from my personal opinion, I believe Google has stopped being active in the open source ML development workflows, while PyTorch has continuously kept updating with more and more features, like DeepSpeed.



What ML project have you worked on that you are most proud of?

For me, the answer to this question keeps changing depending on what I am presently working on :)
If I had to choose one, I would choose the Divya Drishti project. That project not only let me explore multi-modal machine learning but also gave me a chance to meet with the beautiful people of NAB, India.

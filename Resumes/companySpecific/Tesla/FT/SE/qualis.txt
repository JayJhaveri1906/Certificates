Requirements:

- BS/MS in Computer Science, Information Systems, Electrical Engineering or the equivalent in experience

-> Masters in Computer Science. Bachelors in Computer Engineering.


- Evidence of exceptional achievement in academia or industry

-> Yes.

- Proficient in Python

-> Very proficient in Python and have done multiple projects in Python scripting and also using Python as a data analyst/ML tool.
-> Familiar with C, and Java. I strongly believe that I am well adapted to OOP concepts and that I can transfer my learning into C++ too.


- Proficient in front end frameworks

-> Throughout my undergrad I have always given equal importance to frontend along with the backend of my application. This is because only a well designed UI/UX can give justice to an equally capable backend machinery.
-> This has allowed me to work with front-end tools like html, css, javascript and frameworks like React and bootstrap. I had used React and Node JS to help me build the Aatmanirbhar chat application.


- Experience writing and shipping customer-facing code

-> Yes.


- High standards for code quality, maintainability, and performance

-> Yup, in fact I have seen that in industry people are always jumping into the ne and exciting hot topic while pushing maintainability of existing code base to side lines. I strongly insist that maintainability is still a part of the development process and brown field software engineering is as vital as a green field project.


- Willingness to learn new technologies in any area of the stack: Vehicle Control, Routing/Guidance Algorithms, Server Infrastructure, UI, Embedded Systems 

-> Being an Engineer I am always excited and happy to learn new technologies!


Nice to have:

- Experience with Maps / GIS / Computational Geometry data is a strong plus

-> Led a team of 4 to develop an android application that monitors a selected directory and uses multi-part upload methodologies to encrypt and securely upload to the dedicated remote server hosted via Node JS.
-> Utilized Google Maps and Sheets API to build a Bootstrap based website for live tracking feature of the uploader.


Experience in Go, Spark, AWS, Kubernetes, Jenkins is a plus

-> Apart from having multiple courses like Scalable Data systems where we had hands on with scalable architectures like spark I have some project experience when it comes to Amazon RDS database, AWS and Docker/Kubernetes.


Research or development experience in shortest path algorithms is a plus

Envisioning the future of technology and sustainable innovation has always been my professional passion. That's why the prospect of contributing to Tesla's cutting-edge Software Engineering team has me genuinely excited. Armed with a Master's in Computer Science and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, I am eager to leverage my skills and expertise to drive Tesla's mission of transforming the automotive industry :)

Proficient in Python, with a versatile background in Java, C, and OOP, I am well-positioned to seamlessly adapt to the challenges presented by Tesla's dynamic software landscape. During my undergraduate studies, I prioritized balanced application development, excelling in frontend tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Bootstrap. I have hands-on experience in writing and shipping customer-facing code, emphasizing code quality, maintainability, and performance.

Further, I bring leadership experience in developing an Android application called Aatmanirbhar Samakraman which featured multi-part upload methodologies, encryption, and integration of Google Maps and Sheets API for live tracking of application users.

Finally, apart from taking multiple courses like Scalable Data Systems where we had hands-on with scalable architectures like Spark, I have some project experience when it comes to Amazon RDS database, AWS, and Docker/Kubernetes.

I am eager to be part of Tesla's innovative spirit, and I look forward to discussing how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of this Software Engineering team.

Thank you for considering my application, hope you have a great day!

Hi!

I'm Jay, a CS grad student with a passion for developing software and integrating it with AI! As part of my master's program, I have been diving deep into Deep Learning and Computer Vision applications in the real world. My goal is to leverage my skills and experience to drive innovation and progress in the expansive realm of software development. I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded professionals on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in this ever-evolving field!

Why Google, you ask?
Well, who doesn't want to work at Google! I vividly remember being in 9th grade and being in awe of what Google Photos had achieved. It was astonishing to see this marvel of engineering on my first Android phone and to wonder about the technology behind it. This experience inspired me to take up programming as my optional subject in 10th grade, and looking back, it has been the best decision I ever made.

Throughout my undergraduate studies and now in my master's program, I have worked on projects that integrate AI into everyday applications, making technology more accessible and solving real-world problems. When I saw this new grad position open up at Google, with a job description that completely overlapped with my existing experience and my future goals of innovating and making things more accessible, I knew I had to apply!

I would love the chance to work with the versatile and like-minded people at Google to build something amazing!

Looking forward to hearing back :)

Best,
Jay

In addition to my coursework and course projects in relational database management systems, in my past internship at Makos Infotech as a Full Stack Developer, I was responsible to managing their entire AWS-hosted relational database, and connect it to their new platform using MySQL Workbench. To achieve this I developed a server-side rendering for their main website utilizing JQuery, PHP, and MySQL, which targeted automating the On-campus placement process for various colleges. Following this, under the guidance of a senior engineer, I had co-pitched this product to a potential client. By the end of the internship, I was acclaimed multiple times for being on top of my deliverables and was tasked to code review and mentor newer interns.

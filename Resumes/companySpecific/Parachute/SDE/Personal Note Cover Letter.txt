Are you looking for an SDE intern passionate about software engineering and looking for an exciting remote opportunity to gain hands-on experience? :)

You can end your search now...

Okay, jokes aside. I really loved what your company is all about. I am all in favor of giving more power to the common man in matters of health and life care!!

To keep it short, I will say that I would be really lucky if I got the opportunity to be part of your team and help 30000+ people!!! (I love helping people...)(I even choose which projects to do based on how I can help the community! Especially in Health care: Using Figma, I helped design my local hospital their new Android application called TeleMed. Further, my Divya Drishti Project is built to combat the exorbitant and blatant heavy charges OrCam charges to their Visually Impaired customers, to give them some form of vision, which is more than just a human right in my opinion!!)

I would really gain a lot from the 1:1 mentorship program.

Hoping for a positive reply!

Thank you for your time and consideration :)

Best,
Jay

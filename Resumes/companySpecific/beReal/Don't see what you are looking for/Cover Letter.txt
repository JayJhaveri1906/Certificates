Dear Hiring Manager, Be Real,
I recently started using BeReal, and was taken away by the concept so simple, but yet was missing from today's world.

I believe Being Real is gonna be a vital part of the future of social media and I would love to be part of it.

I did notice that you guys are not hiring for any internship roles, hence applying in the "Don't see what you are looking for?" section. I would love to work at BeReal one day!

Best,
Jay

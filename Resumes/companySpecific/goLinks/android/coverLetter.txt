Hi,
I just installed Go/Links extension 5 minutes back, but already it just feels like something that I never knew needed but now I don't think I can go back. (I was running out of space for link shortcuts on my home tab)

I strong believe that I my current skill set, experience in making android apps and goals align with what you are looking for in a potential intern.

I would love the oppurtnuity to work with the best in class teams at GoLinks and contribute to this awsome product!!

Best,
Jay
